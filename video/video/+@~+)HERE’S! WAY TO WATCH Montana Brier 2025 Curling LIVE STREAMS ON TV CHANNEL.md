Last weekend, Rachel Homan cruised to her fifth Scotties Tournament of Hearts title, beating Kerri Einarson 6-1 in the final in Thunder Bay, Ont. Homan's Team Canada came in as the overwhelming favourites to repeat as Canadian women's curling champions and were never seriously challenged, going a perfect 11-0 for the second straight year and winning their three playoff games by a combined score of 24-10.

With the Olympics less than a year away, it was exciting to see the reigning world champs reassert their status as the best women's team on the planet and the clear favourites to win gold in Italy. Long live the Homan Empire! But it was also kind of boring.sed tdfhgsedt gdfrhfgsdetg dfhtfgjg
